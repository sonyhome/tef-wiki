# Contributing

Contributing is done as easily as submitting a pull request to the [main Wiki repo page, found here](https://github.com/TheElectricFursuits/tef-wiki/).

If you are in the group, we can either add you directly as collaborator to allow you to submit your own edits in that repo, or otherwise you can easily make a fork, write up your own content and submit that to us as external PR!
Once the changes are accepted, they're automatically updated onto the Wiki page here. It really is no big deal :>
